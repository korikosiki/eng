# Crowdsale

Crowdsale in the amount of 10% of the total SOON token issue will be held from 15.12.2021 0:00 UTC to 19.12.2021 24:00 UTC

SOON Alliance guarantees that in the pool at the start 1 SOON = $1.5

Declare a 5-day Crowdsale..

On the first day of collection we sell 1 SOON for $0.8 <br>
On the second day, 1 SOON already costs $0.9 <br>
On third $1 <br>
On fourth $1.1 <br>
On fifth $1.2 <br>

All SOON tokens sold will be vested to eliminate the risk of dumping in the liquidity pool.

| Crowdsale day | Cost of 1 SOON | Vesting |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 15.12.2021 | $0.8 | 6 months |
| 16.12.2021 | $0.9 | 5 months |
| 17.12.2021 | $1 | 4 months |
| 18.12.2021 | $1.1 | 3 months |
| 19.12.2021 | $1.2 | 2 months |

> We explain why this is the case. 
> Based on how many coins the "User" will buy on Crowdsale for $100.
>
> On the first day it might be 125 SOON
> And on the fifth day it might only be 83.3333 SOON
> 
> So, in order to minimize risk, with more issuance in the market and a lower SOON token price, the first day should have the maximum vesting per month than the fifth day.
